While I can't discuss much about what I worked on at Meta due to NDAs, I am able to point to articles that involved or were influenced by my work. More links and videos will appear as more is released over time.

During my time at Karuna Labs I helped completely rebuild their clinical and home applications from the ground up. What I contributed spanned across all aspects of the Unity3D Engine, as well as some backend contributions using the Django framework.
