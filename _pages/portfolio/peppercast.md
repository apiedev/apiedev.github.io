PepperCast initially started when a friend of mine reached out to me and asked if I knew what a vocaloid was - which at the time I didn't. My friend John was a lighting engineer for a major concert hall in NYC that hosted raves and EDM shows. He also had a history of being apart of the technical team that created vocaloid concerts in the early 2010s.

I was familiar with the VTubing trend, and knew social platforms like NeosVR and VRChat existed that allowed users to upload their own avatars, but outside of all that virtual performances were something completely foreign to me. He followed up by then asking me if it would be possible to get this vocaloid tech working with VR social platforms that already existed? I honestly had no idea, but I was always down for a challenge. That weekend John and I sat down, I tore through the SDK of VRChat, created a world that gave us the data we needed to stream to John's machine and we had a working proof of concept.

John new of some people that were a part of communities within VRChat that would put on fullbody tracking and dance in VR. We reached out to them to find us talented VR dancers that would want to perform as extras for raves and EDM concerts. Shortly after I created a new studio world, John found a gig that would allow him to incorporate live VR dancers into his lighting effects, and the first Peppercast performance occurred.

John also has a background in dance and theatre, and is currently going to school for his masters in virtual production. Since then we've had many awesome opportunities to work with external studios and art installations to have virtual dancers and DJs perform infront of a live audience in another part of the world.
