### AR Military Device Training Software

The short 6 months I spent at ForgeFX were packed full of learning experiences. It was the first time I developed for an AR headset, being the Hololense 2, and learned very quickly that it was essentially the same as developing for HTC Vive and Oculus headsets. What I worked on with ForgeFX was an application that taught soldiers how to use military devices in field without needing physical versions of the devices. The devices mentioned were CBRND devices, which scanned the environment in multiple ways for biological, radiological, chemical, or nuclear contaminants. My specific job was creating a modular screen for the virtual devices that functioned 1-1 with the screen on the physical device; built within the Unity3D game engine.
